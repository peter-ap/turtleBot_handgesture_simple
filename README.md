# turtleBot_handgesture_simple
This version of the turtlebot handgesture is simplefied. I, this case the commands are translated in forward, backward, turn left and turn right. In the other version you controlled linear and angular speed

-Hand open or out of image -> STOP
-both hands closed (fists) -> drive forward
-only both index fingers are up -> drive backward
-left hand closed right hand open -> turn left
-right hand closed left hand open -> turn right
